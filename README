Metrics Router

Used to provide a common interface for production system metrics. Polls various pieces of production infrastructure for key/value metrics. These metrics are republished onto an MQTT message bus.

Monitoring tools and service status websites subscribe to the MQTT metrics channel to receive the latest production metrics.
A metric message is a key/value pair delimited with a colon.

ie.
webserver1.cpu.load:0.2

Additional metric sources are added by implementing the MerticSource Java interface.
